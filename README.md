# php-seq

php-seq is a Functional-Programming-Language-like linear data structure written
in PHP. I am a fan of FPL (Functional Programming Language) ever since I
learned OPAL in the university. This is a fun project to get some feel for an
FPL in PHP. If you want to know about the beauty of FPL, check the sort
examples in /example directory.
