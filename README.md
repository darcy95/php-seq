# php-seq

php-seq is a Functional-Programming-Language-like linear data structure written in PHP. I am a fan of FPL (Functional Programming Language) ever since I learned OPAL in the university. This is a fun project to get some feel of an FPL in PHP. If you want to know about the beauty of an FPL, check following sort examples.
